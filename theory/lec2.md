# Modals of Computaion and Document Distance

### Terms: 
1. Algorithm: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules designed to perform a specific task or solve a specific problem
<br>
computation procedure for solving a problem.
Or mathematical abstraction of computer program 

2. Abstraction: principle of hiding complex details to simplify problem solving, 
focusing on what operations to do rather than how they are implemented.

3. Computer program: It is a concrete implementation of one or more algorithms in a                 specific programming language.

4. Pseudocode: Pseudocode is a way to describe an algorithm using a mixture of natural language and programming language syntax.

**Diff btwn Algorithms and Pseudocode**
<p>The main differences between pseudocode and an algorithm are:</p>

<p>Representation: An algorithm is a conceptual idea or a set of rules for solving a problem and can be expressed in many ways, including natural language, flowcharts, or pseudocode. Pseudocode is just one of the ways to represent an algorithm, specifically in a format that resembles programming languages but is simpler and more accessible.</p>
<p>Formality: Algorithms can be described in a completely formal mathematical language or in an informal way that just outlines the steps. Pseudocode falls somewhere in between, being less formal than code but more structured than plain language or pure mathematical notation.</p>
<p>Purpose: The purpose of pseudocode is to bridge the gap between an algorithm's theoretical design and its practical implementation. It makes it easier to understand and communicate the algorithm without getting bogged down by the syntax of real code.</p>

#### Note: The definition of terms like Functions, Function Module, Procedure, etc vaires from one language to another.
5. Functions and Function Module:
<p>"Function" is your go-to for specific, often singular tasks, a "function module" in SAP is your more sophisticated tool, capable of carrying out a series of related operations and offering more flexibility and integration with the larger system.</p>
<p>
Imagine you're using a toolkit. A "function" is like a single tool in that kit, such as a screwdriver or a hammer, designed to perform a specific task like tightening a screw or hammering a nail. It's pretty straightforward and has one main job.

A "function module," on the other hand, is like a multi-tool or a Swiss Army knife within the same toolkit</p>

7. Procedure: (Pascal) Procedure is the set of instructions which may or may not involve returning a value

8. Instructions and Commands:-
<p>Key Differences</p>
<p>Level of Abstraction: Instructions operate at a lower level, often directly affecting the hardware, while commands operate at a higher level, instructing software or systems to perform tasks.</p>
<p>Human Readability: Commands are generally more human-readable and are designed to be easier to understand and use, especially in command-line interfaces or scripts. Instructions, especially machine-level instructions, are encoded in a way that is meant for the computer's processor, not for human readability.</p>
<p>Scope: An instruction is a single operation in the processor's language, while a command can encompass a broader action, potentially involving multiple steps or instructions under the hood.</p>

# Recursion
- when a function calls itself
<br>

### Characteristics of Recursive funtion
1. Base Case: condition on which function stops
2. Recursive Case: includes recursive calls
<br>

### diff between recursion and iteration?
<p>Execution Context: Iteration uses the same context; recursion uses separate contexts for each call.</p>
<p>State Management: Iteration manages state with loop variables; recursionâ€™s state is managed through the call stack and parameters.</p>
<p>Memory Usage: Iteration has constant memory usage related to the loop; recursion can consume more memory for the call stack, especially for deep recursion.</p>
<p>Problem Solving Paradigm: Iteration is straightforward repetition; recursion applies divide-and-conquer by solving smaller instances.</p>

### Explain the term arrays as a linear data structure.
Arrays are linear data structures that store elements in contiguous memory locations. They allow random access to elements, which means any element can be accessed directly if the index is known. Arrays are characterized by their fixed size, which is decided at the time of array declaration and cannot be altered during runtime. Elements in an array are usually of the same data type.

### What are the sparse matrices? Give an example.
Sparse matrix isÂ a matrix in which most of the elements are zero.
When a sparse matrix is represented with a 2-dimensional array, we waste a lot of space to represent that matrix. For example, consider a matrix of size 100 X 100 containing only 10 non-zero elements.

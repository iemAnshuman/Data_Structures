# Binary Trees
- root exits
- two degree 
- can be both balanced and unbalanced.
<br>

### Implementation
* using linked list
* node: data, left, right. (is mid possible?)
<br>

```c
struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
};
```
<br>

### repersentation
1. Linked 
2. Sequential(array)



### Types
1. Full binary tree: either a node is leaf 

### Properties
* There are at most 2**l nodes at level...
